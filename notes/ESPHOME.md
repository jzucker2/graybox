### Issues with `friendly_name`

* https://github.com/esphome/feature-requests/issues/2476
* https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-is-friendly-name-supposed-to-behave/542570/9

Turns out that it will shove `friendly_name` in front of an 
entity, _even_ if that entity is already prepended with the 
expanded `${friendly_name}`. This causes it to double so that 
it reads as `Dan Desk Temp Sensor Dan Desk Temp Sensor Uptime Sensor` 
instead of just simply `Dan Desk Temp Sensor Uptime Sensor`.
